//! Independent checks of anchored alignment scores and traceback consumption.
//!
//! The production DP is written for speed. Scores come from a row profile of raw
//! pointers, the matrix is split into a hand-written frontier and a pointer-walking
//! interior, the grid is reused without clearing, and unreachable cells carry a
//! numeric `NEG_INF` rather than an option. A wrong index, a stale cell or a
//! sentinel that drifted into valid range all yield numbers that still look
//! reasonable, so the output has to be checked against something else.
//!
//! `naive_gotoh` is the single reference implementation: three explicit scalar
//! recurrences over a fully initialized matrix, predecessor tracking, and
//! pointer-chase traceback. Exhaustive sequence pairs compare production with it.
//! It does not use production scoring accessors, frontier initialization, pointer
//! arithmetic, or sentinels. The only shared input is the raw `DsmTable` tensor.
//!
//! Inputs are canonical ranks, matching the DP boundary. A result tuple is
//! `(score_including_terminal, query_offset, target_offset)`: offsets are zero-based
//! from the paired anchor, so they also count consumed bases beyond that anchor.
//! Ranks are `Base` discriminants: 0 is a gap, 1 to 5 are A, C, G, N, U. Rank 0
//! never occurs in an input window, only as a tensor coordinate naming the gapped
//! side of a column. Scores are raw tensor units, with no energy conversion.
//!
//! Each sequence pair checks three things: every grid cell production leaves
//! behind, state by state; the reported best score and the endpoint it names; and
//! the trace, compared directly against the reference. Tie-breaking matches
//! production exactly: predecessor priority PAIRED → QUERY_ONLY → TARGET_ONLY,
//! and first-seen optimal endpoint in row-major order.
